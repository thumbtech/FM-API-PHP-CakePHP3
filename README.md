# FM-API-PHP-CakePHP3
Updated FM_API_for_PHP_Standalone Code for PHP 5.4 / CakePHP 3.0 use ...

This is a copy of FM_API_for_PHP_Standalone library delivered with FileMaker Server 14 subject to the following terms:

Even though this is the library delivered with FileMaker Server 14, it is quite old. It reports:

- API Version: 1.1
- Minimum Server Version: 10.0.0.0
 
I've made extensive use of this library outside of CakePHP and it works well. (However, it is just a wrapper on the Custom Web Publishing engine of FileMaker server and I have never understood why it is so convoluted. Seriously ... was the author trying to win a "crazy code" contest?)

Sadly, because class constructors are named after classes (instead of __construct) and no namespaces are defined, the API as delivered by FileMaker is a non-starter for use with CakePHP 3.0.

This version only tries to glue things together for use with CakePHP 3.0 and provide support for composer & autoloading of the *many* classes.

To use, in the composer.json file for your app, include something like:

```
...
"require": {
    ...
    "thumbtech/fm-api-php-cakephp3": "1.*",
    ...
    },
...
```

Eventually, I would like to develop a custom CakePHP 3 datasource for FileMaker that will leverage the PHP API!
